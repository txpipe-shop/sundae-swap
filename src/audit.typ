Below are a list of valid and invalid transactions as diagrams that can be build to interact with Sundae Swap DEX.

=== Operation "create order"

This transaction transfers funds from the user to the Order script address, whose associated validator will then be executed to unlock them. This transaction does not require a validator execution and stores a datum that contains information about the type of Order the user made.

The assets sent are different depending on the type of Order but they all contain at least the maximum protocol fee ADA, the assets relevant to the specific type of Order plus any other assets (optional).

More precisely, the assets relevant to the specific type of Order are:

- Swap: the offered asset given in exchange for the pair's other asset.
- Deposit: both assets from the pair.
- Withdrawal: LP tokens.
- Donation: both assets from the pair.
- Strategy: none.

  ],
)

=== Operation "cancel order"

This transaction spends an Order UTxO with a Cancel redeemer that allows the transfer of those funds wherever the order Owner wants, which must sign the transaction.

The most common use cases are recovering the funds and doing an order update by consuming the order UTxO and producing a new one.

It is worth noting that the order Owner is a multi-sig script, which allows a straightforward signature requirement as just the presence of a specific public key signature as well as a complex Cardano native/simple script-like validation.

Expected Failure Scenarios:
- Owner is *not* signing the transaction

=== Operation "create pool"

This transaction creates a Pool UTxO based on the settings UTxO, which provides various protocol configurations, and funds transfered from the pool creator that act as the initial liquidity. Also, a UTxO which will hold the metadata associated with the pool is created, although the actual metadata information is uploaded in a subsequent transaction that will be performed by the metadata admin.

The minted assets are:
- pool NFT: held within the pool UTxO
- pool reference NFT: used to identify the UTxO that will hold the metadata associated to the pool
- LP tokens: paid to the pool creator. These tokens represent the amount of liquidity provided by the creator

The involved redeemers are:
- `CreatePool`
- `MintLP`

#figure(
  image("img/create_pool.png", width: 100%),
  caption: [
    Create Pool diagram.
  ],
)

Code:
- #link("https://github.com/SundaeSwap-finance/sundae-contracts/blob/bcde39aa87567eaee81ccd7fbaf045543c233daa/validators/pool.ak#L281")[pool.ak:mint():CreatePool]

Expected Failure Scenarios:

- Pool output has the expected address: the pool script address
- Quantities of both tokens of the pair are not a positive integer
- Pool reference NFT is not paid to the metadata output
- Pool NFT or specified quantity of both tokens of the pair are not paid to the pool script address
- Pool value does have more assets than the relevant ones: the pool NFT, protocolFees ADA, and both tokens from the pair
- Pool datum is not valid. One of:
  - Pool identifier is not correct based on the rules defined for ensuring uniqueness
  - The assets property does not match with the tokens pair provided to the pool UTxO
  - Circulating LP property does not equal the minted quantity of LP tokens
  - Fees per ten thousand property is not a positive integer
  - Protocol fees is not a positive integer
- Metadata output does not have a void datum
- The settings UTxO doesn't have a token with the expected policy ID (parameter of the validator)

=== Operation "scoop"

This transaction processes a batch of orders against a particular pool, performed by an authorized scooper.

For each order input there is a related destination output that will contain the assets resulting from the processing of such order (plus a remainder in some cases *TODO list those cases*) and any other assets that were in the order and are not related with the pool. The only exception to this rule are Donation orders that have no reminder i.e. the liquidity ratio of the pool is preserved with the exact amounts provided in the donation.

Both the Pool and Order validators are executed. They are attached to the transaction within reference inputs.

Expected Failure Scenarios:

- Pool output address is not equal than Pool input address
- In the pool datum, other field/s than `circulating_lp` is/are modified
- Pool NFT is stolen from the Pool UTxO or burned
- Pool pair amounts does not match the expected quantities given the specific processed orders
- Pool output has a token that wasn't in the Pool input
- TODO failure scenarios regarding fees
- For each destination output. One of:
  - Is not paid to the destination address specified in the corresponding Order input
  - The destination output doesn't have the datum specified in the corresponding Order
  - The paid value is not consistent with the action defined in the corresponding Order
- For each Order input. One of:
  - If the Order has pool identifier, it does not match with the identifier of the Pool being consumed
  - If the Order is of the Strategy type and doesn't have a defined strategy execution, or if it has a strategy execution defined, is not signed by the expected party
  - The assets contained in the Order does not contain the needed assets to perform the requested action over the Pool
- The market is not open yet i.e. the tx validation range is not contained in the interval [market open POSIX time, +âˆž)
- An incorrect amount of LP tokens are minted/burned if any, or the `circulating_lp` property of the Pool datum is not updated accordingly
- There's no signature of an authorized scooper

=== Operation "withdraw fees"

Transaction description here.

Code:

Expected Failure Scenarios:

- Pool input address and Pool output address are distinct
- In Pool output Datum, any other field than the protocol fees one is updated
- The amount to withdraw specified within the redeemer does not match the amount of ADA taken from the Pool UTxO, or any of the other assets quantities of the UTxO change
- The transaction is not signed by the treasury administrator
- The treasury allowance part is not paid to the treasury address
- The amount to withdraw is greater than the available protocol fees in the Pool UTxO

=== Operation "create settings"

    ],
    recommendation: [
      A quick solution is to fix the check so it compares to 3 or 4 depending
      if ADA is in the pair or not.

      Alternatively, we propose to change the approach for validating the
      output value by building the expected output value and comparing it with
      value equality.
      We think this approach is more straightforward and less error prone as it
      ensures that there is only one possible outcome for the value.
